# Biography
I'm a third year PhD student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) at University of California, Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Paul Grigas. My research interests include Machine Learning and First Order Methods and lately I have been working in application in Online Advertisement.

Areas which I find of great interest is the application of First Order Methods to big data, primal-dual methods, Distributionally Robust Optimization, and WGANs.
