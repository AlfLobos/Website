# Biography
Fifth year PhD student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of California, Berkeley. My main interests, which I have pursued in my research at Berkeley and at Yahoo (Verizon), are the application of optimization and machine learning techniques in large scale problems such as optimal bidding strategies in online advertising and sparse neural network training. My advisor is Paul Grigas. 

As job/academic goals, I'm currently trying to improve my skills as a future data/research scientist and learning more about how economics, optimization and machine learning can be jointly applied in transportation, e-commerce, online-advertising, and other areas.
